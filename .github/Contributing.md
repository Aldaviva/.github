Contributing to this project
===

If you would like to see changes in this project, it would help me the most if you filed an **Issue** describing what and why you want it. This applies to new features, modifications to existing features, fixes, and questions.

Issues are more helpful to me than pull requests because there is less for me to review and merge into the existing codebase.
